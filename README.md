## 1. Description

The following is a Python example of the [Google Earth Engine plugin for QGIS](https://github.com/gee-community/qgis-earthengine-plugin), for monitoring and tracking wildfires on  the Google Earth Engine [API Documentation](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/). This script were adapted from [Google Earth Engine plugin](https://github.com/gee-community/qgis-earthengine-plugin/tree/master/examples) and the Earth Engine [API examples](https://github.com/google/earthengine-api/tree/master/python/examples). In addition, it includes some examples adapted from the examples developed as recommended practices of the [UNSPIDER](https://www.un-spider.org) (oficina de Bonn -Alemania) program.
